# Writing your first C++ Program
In order to get started with C++, we'll need to set up a few things on your computer.

## Reference Material
We'll be using the tutorials at [http://www.learncpp.com](http://www.learncpp.com) as the backbone for this course. It has some great information and dives deeper into the technical aspects of C++. If you want to do some deeper reading into this week's lesson I would skim through sections **0.1-0.4 and 1.1-1.3a**.

## IDEs
C++ is usually written in an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. For robot programming, we'll be using [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/oxygen1), but for now, an online text editor will be fine.

### Cloud9
Cloud9 is a web-based development environment that can be used on any computers (even Chromebooks). We'll be setting one up, so just follow these instructions.
* Go to this link [https://hackclub.com/cloud9_setup](https://hackclub.com/cloud9_setup) 
* Enter your email address and wait for the confirmation to be sent
* Open up the link from support@c9.io and click on **“Create New Account”**
* Enter your **Name** and **Username**
* In the **“What kind of developer are you?”** dropdown, pick **“Student”**
* In the **“How will you use Cloud9?”** dropdown, pick **“Hobby Projects”**
* Complete the captcha, then **STOP**
* When you get the the screen that says “Welcome to Cloud9 Teams,” click the Dashboard button in the upper right
    *   This will allow you to join Cloud9 without having to join hackclub’s team

## Running Code
Once C9 is up and running, you can run a c++ program using the following command in the terminal:

```
$ g++ -o [executable-name] [c++ file name]
```
