# Arm

Now that you know how to make a claw and a roller intake, it is time to learn about a subsystem usually made in conjunction with the two. In this lesson the purpose of the subsystem and the basic code to make it run will be gone over.
## Subsystem Overview

Above is a picture of the entire robot as in order to understand what an arm truly is, the surrounding susbsystems are needed. Attached to the roller intake(the shovel like subsystem) are two bars. The bars are considered the arm of the robot and they are controlled by a motor and its motorcontoller on the other side. This allows the arm to bring the roller intake up or down.

### Purpose

The purpose of the arm is generally to make a part or susbsytem of the robot able to move up or down. Above it was shown how the roller intake was able to move up and down though of course any other subsystem could have been used. The ability to move up and down allowed team 1257's 2019 robot to put balls at different heights.
