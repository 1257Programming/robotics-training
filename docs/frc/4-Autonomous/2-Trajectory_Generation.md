# Trajectory Generation

notes for ryan
- we create segmented trajectories as a fallback in case we don't get smooth, planned trajectories fully working in time
    - a lot easier to test 
- should mention that using ramsete is just one of many ways that the trajectory problem can be solved
- please explain `Trajectories.java` in here :P
