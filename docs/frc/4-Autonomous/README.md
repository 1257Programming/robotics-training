# Autonomous

## Goals

- Learn the principles behind autonomous
- Learn more about commands and robot trajectory
- Learn how to use Shuffleboard to organize auto routines

TODO Outline:

Segmented trajectories - 
- why we use them, they're already preprogrammed but highly recommend trying to make it yourself
- go over how to create the drive distance and turn angle pid commands

Advanced trajectories - 
- go over what they are, why they are useful, and mention how they are hard to program but the work has already been done
- go over how we use pathweaver to generate the waypoints but then we dump them into trajectories.java for further customization
- go over how we can use the Trajectory Visualizer to visualize them
- go over how we can then follow this path
- finally explain the technical details for those interested
