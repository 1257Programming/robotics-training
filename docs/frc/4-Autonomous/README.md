# Autonomous

## Goals

- Learn the principles behind autonomous
- Learn more about commands for making our robot follow preplanned trajectories
- Learn how to organize multiple commands into a full auto routine
- Learn how to use Shuffleboard to choose the desired auto routines

Advanced trajectories - 
- go over what they are, why they are useful, and mention how they are hard to program but the work has already been done
- go over how we use pathweaver to generate the waypoints
- go over how we can then follow this path
- finally explain the technical details for those interested
