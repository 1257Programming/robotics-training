# Control Flow

## Goals

* Learn what the conditional operators are
* Learn what `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements are
* Learn what logical operators are
* Learn what a `switch` statement is
* Learn about `for` loops
* Learn about `while` loops

## Tasks

* Have a variable with a number grade, and print the letter grade corresponding with it
* Have a variable with a number, and then print out all numbers leading up to that number.
  * For instance, if the variable is 5, print "1 2 3 4 5"
* Have a variable with a number, and then print out the following pattern
  * Variable is 5
  * Output:

    \*

    \*\*

    \*\*\*

    \*\*\*\*

    \*\*\*\*\*
  * Variable is 3
  * Output:

    \*

    \*\*

    \*\*\*
  * Bonus: Repeat the pattern in reverse
