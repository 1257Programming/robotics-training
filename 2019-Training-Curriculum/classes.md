# Classes and Other Custom Data Types

## Tasks

* Easy: Person
    * Create a person class that includes variables for name, age, eye color, hair color, height, etc.
    * Create a constructor to initialize these variables.
    * Create a function that prints all of its properties. 

* Medium: Point
    * Create a class called Point that includes an X and a Y coordinate.
    * Create a function that takes in another Point object and returns the distance between the two. 
    * Create a function that takes in another Point object and returns the midpoint between the two. 

* Hard: Pokemon
    * Create a class called Pokemon which includes HP, Speed, Defense, and Attack which are integers on a scale of 1-10. 
    * It should also includes its type which is included in an enum class. 
    * Create a function that allows a Pokemon to battle another given Pokemon and deduct health dependent on defense and attack. 
    * Bonus: Implement types that make certain Pokemon stronger and weaker against others.
