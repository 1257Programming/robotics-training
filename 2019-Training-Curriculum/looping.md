# Looping

## Tasks

* Easy: (use for loop) Print out all the numbers for 1-100.

* Easy: (use while loop) Print out all natural numbers from 1 to n.

* Medium: FizzBuzz
    * Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

* Hard: [Project Euler 1:](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) Multiples of 3 and 5
    * If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

* Hard: Cin a number and cout that number of the Fibonacci sequence. (So if you cin "1" the program should return the first number in the Fibonacci sequence.)

* Extra Hard: [Project Euler 10:](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10) Summation of primes
    * The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
