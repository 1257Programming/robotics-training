## Calculator Program

Create a program that will have the user input a number, an operator, another number, and then evaluate the expression and print out an answer. (Optional: print out the whole equation.)  

Example: User inputs " 5," " *," and " 2," and the program will output "10" (or "5 * 2 = 10").

* Easy: Use if statements to build the calculator.
* Medium: Use a switch statement to build the calculator.
* Hard: In addition to returning the result, have the program say whether that number is even or odd.
* Extra Hard: Have the program say whether the number is prime.
