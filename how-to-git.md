# How to Git

**Step 1.** Go to the repository you want to clone. For instance, if I wanted to clone 
<https://github.com/FRC1257/robotics-training>, I would go to the link. Click on the big green "Clone or Download"
button and click on the clipboard icon that appears.

**Step 2.** Go to your command line. Type `git clone [Hit Control-V]` into your command line and press Enter. 
For instance, for my purposes, I would type `git clone https://github.com/FRC1257/robotics-training.git`.

**Step 3.** Type `cd [Repository]`. For my purposes, I would type `cd robotics-training`.

**Step 4.** Make your changes. If you want to add new files, make sure to **put them into the repository**.

**Step 5.** Type `git add .`. Hit Enter.

**Step 6.** Type `git commit -m "[Message you want to type]"`. Hit Enter.

**Step 7.** Type `git push` and hit Enter.
