# Vendor Dependencies

When we use hardware from a third-party source, we need to place what are called "vendor dependency" files into our robot program. 

A prime example of such hardware would be a motor controller (see [Motors]() for more detail). Say we are using a SPARK MAX controller from REV Robotics--in order for the controller to actually function, we need to get the vendor dependency (a `.json` file) from REV Robotics' [website](http://www.revrobotics.com/sparkmax-software/).

The following steps for managing vendor dependencies can be found on that site:

Similar steps can be followed with other devices, such as the Talon SRX motor controller and navX-MXP gyroscope. What's most important is that we place these files into a folder called `vendordeps`, and put this folder on the **main** file level of the robot program (not in any subfolders like we had with the robot code files).
