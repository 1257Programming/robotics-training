# First Subsystem(Roller Intake)

Now that we have gone over what Command-Based is and what actuators are, we can now try programming our first subsystem: a Roller Intake.
Before we start programming it, it is important to understand what it actually is.

## Subsystem Description

The image above is of our 2019 Competition: Destination Deep Space. The wheels on the outside of the intake were meant to take in balls by spinning inward. It would then eject the balls by spinnign outward. There was also a third state(neutral) were the ball was just supposed to stay in the intake. For the purposes of this example we will assume the wheels are not turning.

These wheels were moved by a motors which were controlled by motor controllers(the things we actually program). For the Purposes of this tuturial we will assume that sparkmaxes were used. Now that we have the subsystem layout out of the way, it's time to start coding!!!!

## Snail Subsystem

Before we make our file to store the subsystem, there is one file we must make which is essential: SnailSubsystem.java. This file is essentially an abstract class that each subsystem class extends in order to gain key abstract functions. For a refresh on what abstract classes are and their uses go our [Polymorphism document](https://github.com/FRC1257/robotics-training/blob/Ethan-Subsystem/java/4.%20Objects/6.%20Polymorphism.md).

We put this file in the subsystems folder and this is the code that will always be inside of it.

```java

package frc.robot.subsystems;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.SubsystemBase;

public abstract class SnailSubsystem extends SubsystemBase {

    public abstract void update();
    public abstract void outputValues();
    public abstract void setUpConstantTuning();
    public abstract void getConstantTuning();
}

```
.
**Now for the line by line reiview:**

* The first line simply declares the package that the file is in
* The second line imports the file: SubsystemBase from wpilibj2. While this is not very relleavnt for this part of the lesson the added functiionality becomes very important.
* The next line actually makes the class. Notice that is extends SubsystemBase which means that it inherits multiple useful functions.
* Then the next four lines have four functions which are all abstract funcions which will have to be defined in the subsystems that inherit this class.
