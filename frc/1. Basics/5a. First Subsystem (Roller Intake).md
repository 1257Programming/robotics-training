# First Subsystem(Roller Intake)

Now that we have gone over what Command-Based is and what actuators are, we can now try programming our first subsystem: a Roller Intake.
Before we start programming it, it is important to understand what it actually is.

## Subsystem Description

The image above is of our 2019 Competition: Destination Deep Space. The wheels on the outside of the intake were meant to take in balls by spinning inward. It would then eject the balls by spinnign outward. There was also a third state(neutral) were the ball was just supposed to stay in the intake. For the purposes of this example we will assume the wheels are not turning.

These wheels were moved by a motors which were controlled by motor controllers(the things we actually program). For the Purposes of this tuturial we will assume that sparkmaxes were used. Now that we have the subsystem layout out of the way, it's time to start coding!!!!
