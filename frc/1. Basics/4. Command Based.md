# Command Based

Now that we've gone over our program structure and some technical knowledge, we're going to discuss some of the basics behind the ideology that goes into each and every one of our `subsystems`. 

Ultimately, to organize our robot code, we use what is known as a **command-based** design pattern. In this framework, all mechanisms on our robot are grouped into what are known as `subsystems`, and each of these `subsystems` can run certain `commands`. In almost all cases, every action that our robot can perform will be a `command`.

## Subsystems

All subsystems on a robot are composed of a few things: actuators (motors/pistons) and sensors. However, we won't worry too much about sensors right now. In a subsystem class, we will organize the according actuators and program their functionality. Also, remember that subsystems must extend `SnailSubsystem`.

Each of these subsystems will have a few actions it can do with these actuators. For instance, a drivetrain can be moved with manual driver control. An intake could either take in or eject a game piece. An elevator can use either manual control, or precise control to get to a specific position.

## Commands

Each of those aforementioned actions are a `command`. At any given time, a `subsystem` can have a single `command` running on it. There are many ways to set the current `command` of a subsystem. The most simple way to do so is to define the default `command` of a subsystem, which will run when no other specified action is sent. The next way to set `commands` to a `subsystem` is to schedule a `command` to be sent when a certain button is pressed on a controller.

For instance, a roller intake might be set up such that whenever nothing is being pressed on the controller, its default `command` is to run at a low, constant speed. Then, if the A button is pressed, we could schedule it to run an ejecting command, and when the B button is pressed, we might schedule it so that it runs an intaking command.
