# Claw Intake

Now that you know how to make a subystem and its supporting files we are going over how to make other subsystems with different features and purposes. The nextfew lessons will be learning about each of the major subsystems that 1257 uses, why they are important and how we can program them.

## Subsystem Overview

### Purpose

The reason team 1257 uses pneumatics is because pneumatics is relatively cheap while also being very strong. A claw needs to reliably hold the balls, cubes or any other game pieces, so a pneumatic claw is also used. An example of this is in the 2018 robot where it was modified with pneumatics to hold cubes well without dropping them.
