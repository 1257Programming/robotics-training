# Command (Roller Intake)

With our subsystem file finished and filled with constants it is now time to go on to the next big topic: Commands.

## What are commands?

The purpose of a command is to make the robot actually complete an action such as intaking or ejecting or even staying neutral. As a result, there is usually one command per state. These commands eventually get called by other parts of the code when an action needs to be done.

## Command File Format

Now that the basic definiton of a command has been gone over it is time to go over a Command File and its format.
```java
package frc.robot.commands.rollerIntake;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.CommandBase;
import frc.robot.subsystems.RollerIntake;


public class RollerIntakeIntakeCommand extends CommandBase {

    public RollerIntakeIntakeCommand() 
    }

    @Override
    public void initialize() {
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
    }

    @Override
    public void end(boolean interrupted) {
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isFinished() {
    }
}
```
Let's go over the imports and the package first.

Now we will briefly look over the purpose of the constructor and the functions
### `public RollerIntakeIntakeCommand()`
### `public void initialize()`
### `public void execute()()`
### `public void end(boolean interrupted)`
### `public boolean isFinished()`
