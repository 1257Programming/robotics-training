# Command (Roller Intake)

With our subsystem file finished and filled with constants it is now time to go on to the next big topic: Commands.

## What are commands?

The purpose of a command is to make the robot actually complete an action such as intaking or ejecting or even staying neutral. As a result, there is usually one command per state. These commands eventually get called by other parts of the code when an action needs to be done.

## Command File Format

Now that the basic definiton of a command has been gone over it is time to go over a Command File and its format.
```java
package frc.robot.commands.rollerIntake;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.CommandBase;
import frc.robot.subsystems.RollerIntake;


public class RollerIntakeIntakeCommand extends CommandBase {

    public RollerIntakeIntakeCommand() 
    }

    @Override
    public void initialize() {
    }

    @Override
    public void execute() {
    }

    @Override
    public void end(boolean interrupted) {
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isFinished() {
    }
}
```
Let's go over the imports and the package first.

Now we will briefly look over the purpose of the constructor and the functions
### `public RollerIntakeIntakeCommand()`

This is the consructor for the  command. All this deals with is defining the intake for usage in the subsequent files.

### `public void initialize()`

This is usually not used by the team though it is important to know that this runs only once when a command is scheduled/called. Therefore, only things that will not change like motor speed constants are set here. Also if a aubsystem may have to reset some values this can be done here too.

### `public void execute()` 

This function runs constantely while the command is running. In fact ir runs every 20 ms. Our team uses this to change the state of the subsystem.

### `public void end(boolean interrupted)`

The end function is run once when the command finishes. It is usually used for reverting the subsystem back to the default state though occcsionally, it is used for other things like setting variables to certain values.

### `public boolean isFinished()`

This function is run as often as the `execute()` function and is in charge of setting the conditions for which the command should stop running. While it is usually used in its default state(the scheduler calls another command), sometimes other things can be made to trigger thid function like a state change.
