# Constants (Roller Intake)

## What Are Constants And When Are They Used?

As you have noticed in our subsystem files, whenever a numerical constant was used such as in the `set()` function, the direct number was used. While the original programmer might understand what that number means and why it's there, other people looking at the code may become confused.

To allay confusion, a `constant`, or a variable assigned to that numerical value, is used. This variable is declared in another file and the `final` keyword is used when making them so they can not be changed while the code is being run. By using a `constant`, a programmer can quickly see the function of that "magic number" in the code and they can quickly modify them in the future since all of the constants are in one place.

### Example Of Constant Usage

Below are two examples of where constants can be useful.

```java
public RollerIntake() {
    rollerIntakeMotor = new CANSparkMax(2, MotorType.kBrushless);
    ...
}
```

turns into

```java
public RollerIntake() {
    rollerIntakeMotor = new CANSparkMax(ROLLER_INTAKE_MOTOR_ID, MotorType.kBrushless);
    ...
}
```

In this example, we take away the "magic number" `2` from our program and replace it with a name so we can see where it is. Also, by moving the number out of this file and putting all of our various constants in the same file, it makes tracking down the value of this number extremely easy.

---

```java
case NEUTRAL:
    rollerIntakeMotor.set(0.0);
    break;
```

turns into

```java
case NEUTRAL:
    rollerIntakeMotor.set(ROLLER_INTAKE_NEUTRAL_SPEED);
    break;
``` 

Now, instead of guessing what 0.0 means (speed, port, some mode), the reader will easily understand that it pertains to the speed during the neutral state.

## The `Constants.java` File

Above, we briefly showed how to use the constants in code. Now we will get to making these constants in our `Constants.java` file. Below is the basic layout of the file.

```java
package frc.robot;

public final class Constants {

    public static class ElectricalLayout {

    }

    public static class Autonomous {

    }

    public static class RollerIntake {

    }

    // Other global constants such as current limit or pi
}


```

Let's break down the file structure:

Within the `Constants` file, there are 3+ subclasses inside of it: `ElectricalLayout`, `Autonomous`, and one class per subsystem. In this case, we only made one subsystem, so we have a single subclass named `RollerIntake`. Each class is sort of a container to better organize our various constants and improve readability.

1. The `ElectricalLayout` has only one purpose: to store the various IDs used by our actuators, controllers, and sensors. Every subsystem has all of there IDs in there. Keep in mind that we most of the time only know the value of these constants when electronics tells us how they wired it, but we can put placeholder values while we are not sure.

2. `Autonomous` is used to hold enums and variables which are only related to autonomous. Don't worry about this for now.

3. In the class relating to a subsystem (`RollerIntake`), variables such as setpoints for advanced topics like PID and more basic topics such as motor speeds are set. For example, `ROLLER_INTAKE_NEUTRAL_SPEED` would be declared here.

## Naming Convention

Constants are named slightly differently compared to normal variables. The reason is to identify them more easily on your code.

* Constants are always upper case.
* Words are separated by underscores.

Example: `ROLLER_INTAKE_EJECT_SPEED`

## Creating Constants

```java
package frc.robot;

public final class Constants {

    public static class ElectricalLayout {
        public final static int ROLLER_INTAKE_MOTOR_ID = 2;
    }

    public static class Autonomous {
        //nothing
    }
    public static class RollerIntake {
        public static double ROLLER_INTAKE_NEUTRAL_SPEED = 0.0;
        public static double ROLLER_INTAKE_INTAKE_SPEED = 1.0;
        public static double ROLLER_INTAKE_EJECT_SPEED = -1.0;
    }

    //Other constants such as current limit
    public static int NEO_550_CURRENT_LIMIT = 25;

}
```

In this example, there is something that may look peculiar. The ID is declared with a `final` keyword while all of the other constants are not. The reason for this is testing. While the ID will never change during the code, the speeds may be adjusted during testing. We will cover this later when we go over constant tuning.

Another important thing to notice is the keywords `public static` in front of every variable. `public` makes the constant globally accessible, and `static` means that this variable belongs to the class itself, not an object of it. For more information on `static` variables, check [this link](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/04/java-static-class-block-methods-variables/). For now, just know that all of our constants must have the prefix `public static`, while `final` is optional.

## Importing Constants and Using Them

Now that all of the constants are declared, they can now be imported into the file where they are to be used. In this case, it is the `RollerIntake` file.

```java
...
import com.revrobotics.CANSparkMax;
import com.revrobotics.CANSparkMax.IdleMode;
import com.revrobotics.CANSparkMaxLowLevel.MotorType;

import static frc.robot.Constants.ElectricalLayout.*;
import static frc.robot.Constants.RollerIntake.*;
import static frc.robot.Constants.NEO_550_CURRENT_LIMIT;

public class Intake extends SnailSubsystem {
    ...
}
```

The imports are made at the very beginning of the file along with the other imports. Here, all the necessary nested classes along with the main class are imported along with certain important variables such as the current limit.

Now that the constants are imported, it is time to put them where they belong. Below is the code from the previous lesson except for the fact that constants are now in it.

```java
package frc.robot.subsystems;

import com.revrobotics.CANSparkMax;
import com.revrobotics.CANSparkMax.IdleMode;
import com.revrobotics.CANSparkMaxLowLevel.MotorType;

import frc.robot.Constants;

import static frc.robot.Constants.ElectricalLayout.*;
import static frc.robot.Constants.RollerIntake.*;
import static frc.robot.Constants.NEO_550_CURRENT_LIMIT;

public class RollerIntake extends SnailSubsystem {

    private final CANSparkMax rollerIntakeMotor;

    public enum State {
        INTAKE,
        EJECT,
        NEUTRAL
    }

    State state = State.NEUTRAL;

    public RollerIntake() {
        rollerIntakeMotor = new CANSparkMax(ROLLER_INTAKE_MOTOR_ID, MotorType.kBrushless);
        rollerIntakeMotor.restoreFactoryDefaults();
        rollerIntakeMotor.setIdleMode(IdleMode.kBrake);
        rollerIntakeMotor.setSmartCurrentLimit(NEO_550_CURRENT_LIMIT);
    }

    @Override
    public void update() {
        switch(state) {
            case NEUTRAL:
                rollerIntakeMotor.set(ROLLER_INTAKE_NEUTRAL_SPEED);
                break;
            case INTAKING:
                rollerIntakeMotor.set(ROLLER_INTAKE_INTAKE_SPEED);
                break;
            case EJECTING:
                rollerIntakeMotor.set(ROLLER_INTAKE_EJECT_SPEED);
                break;
        }
    }

    public void neutral() {
        state = State.NEUTRAL;
    }

    public void eject() {
        state = State.EJECTING;
    }

    public void intake() {
        state = State.INTAKING;
    }

    public State getState() {
        return state;
    }
}
```
