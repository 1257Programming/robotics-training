# First Bindings(Roller Intake)

Now that we have created the commands we now need away to actually call/use them. This is where the bindings come in. All of the comands are binded to certain buttons on the x box controller so we can actually start driving the robot. In Robot Container we will actually do the bindings. Certain functions in this file will not be include for simplicity sake so read other lessons to get a full picture of what this file should entail.

## Robot Container File Format
Below is the basic format of the `Robot Container` File. This tutorial does not explain all of the functions that will be inside of it as they will be covered in future lessons


package frc.robot;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.Command;

import frc.robot.commands.intake.RollerIntakeNeutralCommand;
import frc.robot.commands.intake.IntakeIntakeNeutralCommand;
import frc.robot.commands.intake.EjectIntakeNeutralCommand;

import frc.robot.util.SnailController;

import static frc.robot.Constants.ElectricalLayout.CONTROLLER_DRIVER_ID;
import static frc.robot.Constants.ElectricalLayout.CONTROLLER_OPERATOR_ID;

public class RobotContainer {

    public RobotContainer() {
    }

    private void configureButtonBindings() {
    }
}

## Package and Imports Overview

* The package is very self explanatory. It is in the robot folder which is inside of frc.

* The first file imported is the wpilib command file. This file is necesary to adequately bind commands.
* Next, the commands we already created are imported. They are needed so the binding can happen as well.

* Next comes the `SnailController` import. This is imported in order to make the xBox controllers.
* Lastly the constants that control the Electrical Layout of the controllers are imported. All that needs to be known about them is that the Driver Controller is always 0 while the Operator is 1.

## Function Overview

### `RobotContainer()`

This is the constructor for the class. The Snail Controllers(XBox controllers), the subsystems and their default commands are defined here. In more complicated subsystems, other objects may also be defined here.

### `configureButtonBindings()`

This function is where all the button bindings actually happen. Specifically, when a certain button is pressed on a certain controller, a certain command gets run.

## Adding Functionality

### XBox Controller and Subsystem Declerations

The first thing we do within the class is declare the neccesary objects. Below are the basic objects that need to be declared.

```java
public class RobotContainer {

    private final SnailController driveController;
    private final SnailController operatorController;
    
    private final RollerIntake rollerIntake;
    ...
```
* The first two objects we declare are the SnailControllers which is class which extends the original XboxController class. SnailController is used to add extra functionality to the original class. One of them is named the `driveController` which controls the drivetrain. The other one is called the `opertorController` which controls just about everything else.
* Then, the subsystems are declared. In this case, we only have one subsystem so only one gets declared.

### The Constructor

```java
public RobotContainer() {
    driveController = new SnailController(CONTROLLER_DRIVER_ID);
    operatorController = new SnailController(CONTROLLER_OPERATOR_ID);

    rollerIntake = new RollerIntake();
    rollerIntake.setDefaultCommand(new RollerIntakeNeutralCommand(rollerIntake));
}
```
* The first things defined here are the  SnailControllers. Notice how the arguments are the the ID's that were previously imported.
* Next, the rollerIntake is defined.
* Lastly, the default command for the `RollerIntake` sent. A default command is a command that runs for a subsystem when no  other command is scheduled. Since we do not want the robot to do anything until we press a button, we set the default command to the `RollerIntakeNeutralCommand`.

### Binding Commands To The Buttons

private void configureButtonBindings() {

        operatorController.getButton(Button.kX.value).whileActiveOnce(new RollerIntakeEjectCommand(rollerIntake));
        operatorController.getButton(Button.kA.value).whileActiveOnce(new RollerIntakeIntakeCommand(rollerIntake));
        
}
In short, the X button is being binded to the `RollerIntakeEjectCommand` while the A button is being binded to the `RollerIntakeIntakeCommand`.

Now lets do the long explanation.

#### getButton()

* When this function is run, it returns a Joystick object which is a subclass of Button. The specific button it returns depends on the parameter. The format for the parameter is Button.k(button).value. So in the first case it would return the X button.
* Now that a Joystick object has been returned, a multitude of functions could be used. The second function in function1().function2() is called a decorator.

#### The Possible Functions

While there are over 5 functions to choose from, our team only regularly uses two of them: whileActiveOnce and whenPressed.

**whileActiveOnce():** This function signifies that if the button is held down, then the command will run. Though when the button is let go, the default command will start running or the next command in the queue.

**whenPressed:** This function means that when the button is pressed, the command is run once and then it reverts to the default command immediately.

#### The Function We Chose

Since we want the motors to spin as long as the button is pressed, we use the `whileActiveOnce()` function. Inside of the paraenthesis is the argument which is a command. The `new` keyword is used before the command is written as the command is an object.  Inside of the parameters of the Command, the rollerIntake created in `RobotContainer` is passed in.

import static frc.robot.Constants.ElectricalLayout.CONTROLLER_OPERATOR_ID;

public class RobotContainer {

    private final SnailController driveController;
    private final SnailController operatorController;
    
    private final Intake intake;

    public RobotContainer() {
        driveController = new SnailController(CONTROLLER_DRIVER_ID);
        operatorController = new SnailController(CONTROLLER_OPERATOR_ID);

        rollerIntake = new RollerIntake();
        rollerIntake.setDefaultCommand(new RollerIntakeNeutralCommand(rollerIntake));
    }

    private void configureButtonBindings() {
        operatorController.getButton(Button.kX.value).whileActiveOnce(new RollerIntakeEjectCommand(rollerIntake));
        operatorController.getButton(Button.kA.value).whileActiveOnce(new RollerIntakeIntakeCommand(rollerIntake));
    }
}
