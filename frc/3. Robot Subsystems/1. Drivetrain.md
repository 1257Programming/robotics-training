# Drivetrain

## What a Drivetrain Is

A drivetrain is defined as `the group of components that deliver power to the driving wheels`. When looking at robots, it consists of essentially everything to do with the driving wheels. When we program the drivetrain, we are essentially making the robot move.

## How Our Drivetrain Works

We almost always use the above drivetrain: a 6 wheel tank drive (We actually use something known as a 6 wheel drop center tank drive, but it's not important to what we are discussing. If you want to learn more, Google it)

The main thing to take away from this drivetrain is that unlike a car, the wheels can not rotate left or right. Instead, they are fixed in place and can only spin forward or backwards. This restricts our movement, but also makes it much easier to build and program.

While we have 6 wheels, we actually only have 4 motors controlling those 6. We call those motors `frontLeft`, `frontRight`, `backLeft`, and `backRight`.

With this design, going backwards and forwards is very easy. We simply set all of the wheels to driving full speed forwards or backwards. However, turning gets a bit more complicated. For turning with a tank drive system, we have to spin the two sides of the drivetrain in different directions. For instance, to turn right, we would have to spin the right wheels backwards and the left wheels forwards. This would do a rotation about the center of our robot.

The above doesn't seem that bad to program until we get to the fact that driving forward and turning at the same time can be a bit challenging. While the code isn't that bad, our implementation can be buggy at first and be pretty long. Luckily, FRC makes this much easier for us by introducing a class called `DifferentialDrive`. What this class does is introduce a way to control our motors for us and do the math to turn what we want into the individual motor outputs. For instance, all we have to do is tell `DifferentialDrive` that the robot should drive forward at full speed while turning right at half speed. Then, `DifferentialDrive` will take in these commands, do the math, and then update the motors accordingly to make the robot perform this action.

Note: If you want to see the math for yourself, you can look at `DifferentialDrive`'s source code [here](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/blob/master/wpilibj/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/DifferentialDrive.java) 

## DifferentialDrive

Looking at the documentation for `DifferentialDrive` at <http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/beta/docs/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/DifferentialDrive.html>, we can notice a few things.

First of all, to create this object and use it, we must look at its constructor.

We notice that it takes in two objects of type `SpeedController`. Luckily, the `WPI_TalonSRX` objects that we made before for our wheels extend `SpeedController`. Through **polymorphism**, we can actually just passs in our left and right motors. But wait, we have 2 different right motors and 2 different left motors! We will get to this issue later, for know, just pass in `frontLeft` and `frontRight`.

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.*;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.drive.*;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.*;

public class Robot extends IterativeRobot {

    WPI_TalonSRX frontLeft;
    WPI_TalonSRX frontRight;
    WPI_TalonSRX backLeft;
    WPI_TalonSRX backRight;
    XboxController controller;

    DifferentialDrive driveTrain;

    public void robotInit() {
        // Runs once when the robot is turned on

        frontLeft = new WPI_TalonSRX(1);
        frontRight = new WPI_TalonSRX(2);
        backLeft = new WPI_TalonSRX(3);
        backRight = new WPI_TalonSRX(4);
        controller = new XboxController(1);

        driveTrain = new DifferentialDrive(frontLeft, frontRight);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        // Runs repeatedly when the robot is in teleop


    }
}
```

Note that we had to put `import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.drive.*;`. This is due to the fact that `DifferentialDrive` is found within the `wpilibj.drive` folder, not `wpilibj`. As a result, we must put another import statement to make this class available.

Now that we've created our `DifferentialDrive` object, we now want to use it so that we can drive our robot. Looking at its methods, we can see a lot of its functionality. For instance, we can see methods like `drive()`, `tankDrive()`, and `arcadeDrive()`. While our drivetrain is called a tank drive, the way we control our robot is a bit different. Instead, we use something known as `arcadeDrive()`.

Essentially, `tankDrive()` allows you to use each joystick to control the two separate sides of the robot separately, which is a bit clunky and not traditionally what 1257 uses.

Instead we use `arcadeDrive()`, which allows you to pass in a `moveValue` and a `rotateValue`. You may notice that there are a different implementations of `arcadeDrive()` with different amounts/types of arguments. Specifically, one takes in an extra argument called `squaredInputs`. What `squaredInputs` does is, if set to true, that it causes all inputs that are sent into the `arcadeDrive()` to be squared before being sent to the robot. For instance, if we sent in a value of `0.8` as the forward speed, it would actually send a value of `0.64` to the robot. This is useful for more precise movements, and we use the version of `arcadeDrive()` without the `squaredInputs` parameter because it will automatically set `squaredInputs` to true.

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.*;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.drive.*;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.*;

public class Robot extends IterativeRobot {

    WPI_TalonSRX frontLeft;
    WPI_TalonSRX frontRight;
    WPI_TalonSRX backLeft;
    WPI_TalonSRX backRight;
    XboxController controller;

    DifferentialDrive driveTrain;

    public void robotInit() {
        // Runs once when the robot is turned on

        frontLeft = new WPI_TalonSRX(1);
        frontRight = new WPI_TalonSRX(2);
        backLeft = new WPI_TalonSRX(3);
        backRight = new WPI_TalonSRX(4);
        controller = new XboxController(1);

        driveTrain = new DifferentialDrive(frontLeft, frontRight);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        // Runs repeatedly when the robot is in teleop

        driveTrain.arcadeDrive(1.0, 0.5);
    }
}
```

What this does is that it constantly tells our robot, every loop, to drive forward at full speed while turning clockwise at half speed. Now, in order to make this actually useful, we want to combine our controller with this.

## Controller Inputs

TODO later, also reminder to put analog inputs in Controllers.md
