## Drive Schemes

To understand why we use certain drive schemes at certain points, and why our drivers have three simultaneously avalible to them, we need to understand the limitations of them.

Two of the driving modes avalible to our drivers are simply "split arcade" control schemes, where one axis of the arcadeDrive() controller is the X and the other is the Y, swapped per joystick in each mode.  This enables our driver to use what works for them, but also for build and control systems testing.  The last mode is a regular "tank drive" where each stick's vertical movement is mapped to a side of the drivetrain.  While more difficult to use, it does enable some more advanced robot driving when neccesary, such as spinning in place, or lining up a difficult endgame.

Other teams may opt to use different drive schemes depending on the experience of their drive team.  Though this is less a programming topic and more a strategy / drive team topic, it's immediately relevant to programming.  If, for example, our driver had years of practice driving in a racing videogame, we might make our control scheme more similar to the one they expect to enable them to learn quicker.  Just consider for a moment if we're going to use a Dance Dance pad and Donkey Kong bongos, we might not be making the most ideal setup...
