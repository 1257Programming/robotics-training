## Drive Schemes

To understand why we use certain drive schemes at certain points, and why our drivers have three simultaneously avalible to them, we need to understand the limitations of them.

Two of the driving modes avalible to our drivers are simply "split arcade" control schemes, where one axis of the arcadeDrive() controller is the X and the other is the Y, swapped per joystick in each mode.  This enables our driver to use what works for them, but also for build and control systems testing.  The last mode is a regular "tank drive" where each stick's vertical movement is mapped to a side of the drivetrain.  While more difficult to use, it does enable some more advanced robot driving when neccesary, such as spinning in place, or lining up a difficult endgame.
