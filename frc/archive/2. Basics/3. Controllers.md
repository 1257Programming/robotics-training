# Controllers

Now that we know how to control a motor with code, let's get onto the main key things about teleoperated mode: the controllers. Essentially, we want to be able to take in controller inputs and depending on those inputs, send certain speeds to the motor. For instance, let's program in a program where if the A button on a controller is pressed, the motor goes forward with a speed of 1.0. If the B button is pressed, the motor goes backward with a speed of -1.0.

## XboxController

At 1257, we use primarily Xbox controllers. For those of you who haven't seen an Xbox controller, here:

To use this in code, we make use of an XBox Controller object, provided to us by WPILib.  In the event we wanted to use something *other* than an XBox Controller, we could use the GenericHID object and build extensions on top of it the same way the XboxController object works.  Below is a use of the XboxController object in sample robot code.

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.*;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.*;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {

    WPI_TalonSRX motor;
    XboxController controller;

    public void robotInit() {
        // Runs once when the robot is turned on

        motor = new WPI_TalonSRX(2);
        controller = new XboxController(1);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        // Runs repeatedly when the robot is in teleop

        // Future Controller Code Here
    }
}
```

Note that I've kept the motor code from the last document. Here, we're making a XboxController variable called `controller` and setting it equal to an XboxController object with a port of 1. All this code does is make a new `controller` variable that corresponds with the physical Xbox Controller plugged into port 1 of our computer. We can now use this `controller` to get user input.

For instance, we can do the following:

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.*;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.*;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {

    WPI_TalonSRX motor;
    XboxController controller;

    public void robotInit() {
        // Runs once when the robot is turned on

        motor = new WPI_TalonSRX(2);
        controller = new XboxController(1);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        // Runs repeatedly when the robot is in teleop

        if(controller.getAButton())
        {
            motor.set(1.0);
        }
        else
        {
            motor.set(0.0);
        }
    }
}
```

What this does is that every loop, it will check if the A button on the controller is being pressed. If it is, it will set the motor's speed to 1.0, and if it isn't, then the motor's speed will be set to 0.0. This way, we have a simple program so that the motor only moves when the A button is being pressed.

Now, you might be asking, how will I know what functions the XboxController has? To do that, you can go to here: [Documentation](https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/XboxController.html). To find this, you can also type: `wpilib xbox controller java documentation` into Google and it should be one of the first few results. This documentation displays a ton of information about the class, as well as what to pass into it's constructor, what variables it has, what it does, and what functions it has. An incredibly valuable skill of robot programmers is the ability to use documentation. Here is a link to the main page of the [documentation](https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/index.html).

If you look in there, and you search for B button, you can find the function `getBButton()`, which returns `true` when the B button is pressed and `false` when it is not. Therefore, we can now extend our code:

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.*;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.*;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {

    WPI_TalonSRX motor;
    XboxController controller;

    public void robotInit() {
        // Runs once when the robot is turned on

        motor = new WPI_TalonSRX(2);
        controller = new XboxController(1);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        // Runs repeatedly when the robot is in teleop

        if(controller.getAButton())
        {
            motor.set(1.0);
        }
        else if(controller.getBButton())
        {
            motor.set(-1.0);
        }
        else
        {
            motor.set(0.0);
        }
    }
}
```

## Note

Let's consider the following: what would happen if we removed the `else` block of the if statement?

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.*;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.*;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {

    WPI_TalonSRX motor;
    XboxController controller;

    public void robotInit() {
        // Runs once when the robot is turned on

        motor = new WPI_TalonSRX(2);
        controller = new XboxController(1);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        // Runs repeatedly when the robot is in teleop

        if(controller.getAButton())
        {
            motor.set(1.0);
        }
        else if(controller.getBButton())
        {
            motor.set(-1.0);
        }
    }
}
```

What would happen is that when the A button is pressed and then released, the robot will continue driving forward. This is because the motor's value is never zerod out and will stay at 1.0 until changed. The same can be said for the B button.

Now what will happen if both the A and B button are pressed at the same time?

In this case, the motor will drive forward. This is because the B button is checked within an `else if` block, so it will only be checked if the A button is not pressed. As a result, the code will see the A button is pressed and drive forward.

## Multiple Motors

In our robot, we frequently have 4 drive motors, back left, back right, front left, and front right.

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.*;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.*;

public class Robot extends TimedRobot {

    WPI_TalonSRX frontLeft;
    WPI_TalonSRX frontRight;
    WPI_TalonSRX backLeft;
    WPI_TalonSRX backRight;
    XboxController controller;

    public void robotInit() {
        // Runs once when the robot is turned on

        frontLeft = new WPI_TalonSRX(1);
        frontRight = new WPI_TalonSRX(2);
        backLeft = new WPI_TalonSRX(3);
        backRight = new WPI_TalonSRX(4);
        controller = new XboxController(1);
    }

    public void teleopPeriodic() {
        // Runs repeatedly when the robot is in teleop

        if(controller.getAButton())
        {
            frontLeft.set(1.0);
            frontRight.set(1.0);
            backLeft.set(1.0);
            backRight.set(1.0);
        }
        else if(controller.getBButton())
        {
            frontLeft.set(-1.0);
            frontRight.set(-1.0);
            backLeft.set(-1.0);
            backRight.set(-1.0);
        }
    }
}
```

This is the most rudimentary program that can move a robot chassis with four motors. If the A button is pressed, all four motors will be set to full speed, forward. Likewise, the B button will set all four motors full speed backwards.
