# Binding Commands

We will link our commands to controller inputs through `RobotContainer.java`.

Take a look at what we have so far in it:

```java
package frc.robot;

import static frc.robot.Constants.*; // import the Constants class so we can use the variables in it easily

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.XboxController;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.XboxController.Button;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.JoystickButton;
import frc.robot.commands.intake.EjectCommand;
import frc.robot.commands.intake.IntakeCommand;
import frc.robot.commands.intake.NeutralCommand;
import frc.robot.subsystems.Intake;

/**
 * This class is where the bulk of the robot should be declared.  Since Command-based is a
 * "declarative" paradigm, very little robot logic should actually be handled in the Robot
 * periodic methods (other than the scheduler calls).  Instead, the structure of the robot
 * (including subsystems, commands, and button mappings) should be declared here.
 */
public class RobotContainer {

    private final Intake intake;

    private final XboxController controller;

    /**
     * The container for the robot.  Contains subsystems, OI devices, and commands.
     */
    public RobotContainer() {
        intake = new Intake();
        intake.setDefaultCommand(new NeutralCommand(intake));

        controller = new XboxController(CONTROLLER_ID);

        configureButtonBindings();
    }

    /**
     * Use this method to define your button -> command mappings.
     */
    private void configureButtonBindings() {

    }
}
```

## Binding Controls to Commands

With `XboxController`, binding commands to the buttons is a bit tedious, but overall not too bad. We want to run the `IntakeCargoCommand` when the B button is pressed on our operator controller. And then we want the `EjectCargoCommand` to be run when the A button is pressed. So we do the following in `configureButtonBindings()`:

```java
package frc.robot;

import static frc.robot.Constants.*; // import the Constants class so we can use the variables in it easily

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.XboxController;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.XboxController.Button;
import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.button.JoystickButton;
import frc.robot.commands.intake.EjectCommand;
import frc.robot.commands.intake.IntakeCommand;
import frc.robot.commands.intake.NeutralCommand;
import frc.robot.subsystems.Intake;

/**

 * (including subsystems, commands, and button mappings) should be declared here.
 */
public class RobotContainer {

    private final Intake intake;

    private final XboxController controller;

    /**
     * The container for the robot.  Contains subsystems, OI devices, and commands.
     */
    public RobotContainer() {
        intake = new Intake();
        intake.setDefaultCommand(new NeutralCommand(intake));

        controller = new XboxController(CONTROLLER_ID);

        configureButtonBindings();
    }

    /**
     * Use this method to define your button -> command mappings.
     */
    private void configureButtonBindings() {
        (new JoystickButton(controller, Button.kA.value)).whenPressed(new EjectCommand(intake));
        (new JoystickButton(controller, Button.kB.value)).whenPressed(new IntakeCommand(intake));
    }
}

```

Essentially, for the controller, we do a bit of weird code to access the variable for the button: `(new JoystickButton(controller, Button.kA.value))`. However we can easily copy and paste this and then replace `kA` with any button we like. The k doesn't really mean anything important, it's just part of a style of variable naming called "Hungarian notation." 

We can then call a function on each of these variables to configure a command to be run when a certain action is applied to it. Here are a few pre-programmed actions that you can use:

- `whenPressed()` - runs the command once when the button is first pressed
- `whileHeld()` - runs the command continuously while the button is pressed
- `whenReleased()` - runs the command once when the button is released
- `toggleWhenPressed()` - toggles the running of a command when the button is pressed

Now that we've done this, our roller intake is complete! The full code for this can be found within the `/programs/` folder.
