# Custom PID

[This](https://github.com/Team2590/FRC2590-2017/blob/master/src/org/usfirst/frc/team2590/Controllers/DriveAtAngleController.java)
is FRC Team 2590's code for the distance/angle PID controller. Notice that it looks nothing like our PID controllers in our robot,
or even the PID controllers in WPILib -- they created their custom PID. After all, PID is a theory combined with a control loop; 
WPILib just pre-made a version. They still have their setpoints, their PID constants, and calculations. 

Honestly, custom PID is just using the PID theory and control loop. Everything else is at your discretion.
