# Match Structure

## States

For each state of the robot, there are two functions, `init` and `periodic`. Essentially, when that state starts, the `init` function is run once, and after that, the `periodic` function repeats constantly at 50Hz, or 50 times a second.

### Disabled

When the robot is turned on but not activated, it is disabled. In this state, the robot's motors shouldn't move. The code in `disabledInit()` runs once while the code in `disabledPeriodic()` runs 50 times per second. We don't use disabled that much, besides a bit of code in `disabledPeriodic()` to log sensor values.

### Autonomous

In the autonomous period, the robot must complete some task **on its own, without human input**. The code in `autonomousInit()` runs once while the code in `autonomousPeriodic()` runs 50 times per second. Most of our code is in `autonomousInit()`. This is because we mostly want to run our auto commands/pathing only once, so we put them in `autonomousInit()` so that they are run the instant the autonomous period starts.

### Teleoperated

In the teleoperated period, the robot can take human input to complete tasks. The code in `teleopInit()` runs once while the code in `teleopPeriodic()` runs 50 times per second. Most of our code is in `teleopPeriodic()`. This is because we mostly want to constantly update our robot with new controller inputs from the players.

## Match Order

When we load the robot onto the field, the robot is in its disabled state. Once the match starts, autonomous begins and it lasts for 15 seconds. Then, teleoperated begins and lasts for 75 seconds. Finally, once teleoperated ends, the match ends and the robot goes back to disabled.
