### Autonomous Period

In the autnonmous period, the robot must complete some task **on its own, without human input**. The code in `void autonomousInit()` runs once while the code in `void autonomousPeriodic()` runs 50 times per second. Most of our code is in `autonomousInit()`.

### Teleoperated Period

In the teleoperated period, the robot can take human input to complete tasks. The code in `void teleopInit()` runs once while the code in `void teleopPeriodic()` runs 50 times per second. Most of our code is in `teleopPeriodic()`.
