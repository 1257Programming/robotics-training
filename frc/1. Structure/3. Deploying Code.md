# Deploying Code

To make our code actually work, we have to have installed VSCode with the WPILib extension. The steps for this can be found on the WPILib ScreenstepsLive documentation [here](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc#windows)  Once this is done, you can go to the top right corner of the copy of VSCode on your desktop, where you will see an icon for WPILib. If we don't already have a robot code project, you can use the steps below to create a new robot project.

To actually deploy our created robot code, we simply use the "Deploy Robot Code" option in the WPILib command pallette, which can also be done via the 'Shift + F5' key-command.  This option automatically builds and deploys all of our robot code to the roboRIO.  It will error out and not deploy any code if your code has a compiler error, which will be found in the "Error" box at the bottom of your screen.

## Creating A New Project

Click the "WPILib" button in the top right and type "new" and click the option to create a new robot project.

Enter in the above settings and hit generate. In the bottom right, there should be a dialog to open the new project, hit yes.

Finally, you have a project you can work with. There should be some generated code in the source folder, you can edit that and replace it with your code. To build this code and check for errors, you can go to the WPILib menu again and hit `Build Robot Code`.

Once you are connected to a robot either through WiFi or tether, you can go to WPILib and then go to `Deploy Robot Code` to send the code to the robot. After this, congrats! You have pushed robot code!

To actually run your code, you need a program called `Driver Station`. This sadly isn't available for Mac OS as of now, so one needs a Windows computer to use it. Once `Driver Station` has been run, you can select the different robot modes to activate. However, always make sure that surroundings are clear before activating the robot, as anything could go wrong. If anything goes wrong, hitting `Space` will emergency stop the robot and prevent it from harming anyone.
