# FRC Programming

***If you haven't gone through the Java tutorials yet, go through those first***

## Libraries

To program robots, we use a combination of Java and WPILib. Essentially, there is a lot of code that goes into programming robots, most of which is incredibly complicated and time-consuming. As a result, to help access things like motors, time things like the different robot periods, and manage complicated procedures like PID, we use already written code. All of this code is compiled into something called a library called WPILib.

## WPILib

WPILib contains a lot of classes that help with managing motors, sensors, and sync your robot. They also give different structures for maintaining the flow of the robot program.

## IDE

Up until this point, we have been using repl.it. However, to use robot code, we program in Visual Studio Code, which cannot be downloaded on Chromebooks. As a result, it is greatly appreciated if you all bring in your own computers. We can probably also form groups and some of you will have to program together. If you bring in your computer and ask me, I can help you set it up. You can also follow [this](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/79833/l/932382-installing-vs-code) guide.

It is highly suggested to, if you can, practice robot programming on a real computer. This way, you can see your errors and actually practice building your programs and getting comfortable with the program structure.

## Testing

In the past, we could always test your program ASAP. We would just have to hit the run button and the computer would run it. However, with robot code, we will not always have access to the robot. We can always ask for it, but we will have to wait much longer in between tests. As a result, it will be more difficult to test robot code.
