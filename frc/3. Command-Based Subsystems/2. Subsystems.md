# Subsystems

Each subsystem in our robot code is in its own `class`, which is in its own file. As mentioned before, a subsystem represents some mechanism or collection of hardware on the robot. In the `class` are the subsystem's data and methods that can be referenced later in the `commands`. 

For the purpose of this demonstration, we will consider one of the most simple types of subsystems we commonly build: a roller intake. To visualize this, we will utilize our 2019 robot for the game Destination: Deep Space.

The subsystem of focus here is the green wheeled mouth system, which is our roller intake for taking in the cargo balls.

Essentially, there is a single motor hooked up to those wheels, and when it is run, the intake can take in cargo. When it is run the other way, it will eject them. We build these **a lot**, so if you can understand how to program this, it will greatly help.

## Basic Code

```java
package frc.robot.subsystems;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.SubsystemBase;

public class Intake extends SubsystemBase {

    public Intake() {

    }

    /**
     * Called periodically when run by the CommandScheduler
     */
    @Override
    public void periodic() {

    }
}
```

This is the basic boilerplate code for a subsystem. One thing to notice is that this `Intake` extends the `SubsystemBase` class, which is included in WPILib (note the corresponding import statement). Overall, this subclassing is necessary for `command-based` to work. The `periodic()` function can be used to update subsystem-specific states. Generally, we want to make this in a new file called `Intake.java` and put it inside of a folder called `subsystems`.

(A quick word about `@Override`: all this does it check to make sure the following function has the correct spelling/arguments. It won't change any functionality, although it is better practice to keep it in order to avoid accidentally changing the function to "periodc" and having a headache debugging.)

## Actuators

The next step is to implement the actual actuators (motors, pistons) that are on our subsystem. In this case, we have a single `WPI_VictorSPX` that controls the roller. Note that we *will* need the `Phoenix.json` vendor dependency and a corresponding import statement.

```java
package frc.robot.subsystems;

import static frc.robot.Constants.*;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.SubsystemBase;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.WPI_VictorSPX;

public class Intake extends SubsystemBase {

    private WPI_VictorSPX intakeMotor;

    public Intake() {
        intakeMotor = new WPI_VictorSPX(INTAKE_MOTOR_ID);
    }

    /**
     * Called periodically when run by the CommandScheduler
     */
    @Override
    public void periodic() {

    }
}
```

Note that we used the `Constants` file to store the id for the motor. It looks like this:

```java
package frc.robot;

/**
 * The Constants class provides a convenient place for teams to hold robot-wide numerical or boolean
 * constants.  This class should not be used for any other purpose.  All constants should be
 * declared globally (i.e. public static).  Do not put anything functional in this class.
 *
 * It is advised to statically import this class (or one of its inner classes) wherever the
 * constants are needed, to reduce verbosity.
 */
public final class Constants {
    public static int CONTROLLER_ID = 0;

    public static int INTAKE_MOTOR_ID = 0;
}
```

## States

Next, we have to consider something called the `state` of the `subsystem`. Essentially, a `state` is a configuration that we could put the `subsystem` into. Let's consider the intake, which has some of the most simple `states`.

The intake has three `states`:

- NEUTRAL - doing nothing
- INTAKING - spinning inwards to take in a ball
- EJECTING - spinning outwards to eject a ball

You can think of the `state` of the `subsystem` as sort of a bunch of buttons and switches that change the internal configuration/setup of the subsystem. You will be able to change this internal configuration as much as you want, but nothing will actually happen to the motors in the subsystem until you push the `update` switch.

## States in Code

At any time, the subsystem will have a variable that refers to the current state of the subsystem. We use an `enum` to represent this state.

```java
package frc.robot.subsystems;

import static frc.robot.Constants.*;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.SubsystemBase;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.WPI_VictorSPX;

public class Intake extends SubsystemBase {

    private WPI_VictorSPX intakeMotor;

    public enum State {
        NEUTRAL,
        INTAKING,
        EJECTING
    }
    private State state = State.EJECTING;

    public Intake() {
        intakeMotor = new WPI_VictorSPX(INTAKE_MOTOR_ID);
    }

    /**
     * Called periodically when run by the CommandScheduler
     */
    @Override
    public void periodic() {

    }
}
```

## Updating our State

Now that we have a variable to represent the internal state of our subsystem, we have to be able to somehow update that state and change it. The way we do this is by creating various functions within our class that will change the state to the corresponding value.

```java
package frc.robot.subsystems;

import static frc.robot.Constants.*;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.SubsystemBase;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.WPI_VictorSPX;

public class Intake extends SubsystemBase {

    private WPI_VictorSPX intakeMotor;

    public enum State {
        NEUTRAL,
        INTAKING,
        EJECTING
    }
    private State state = State.EJECTING;

    public Intake() {
        intakeMotor = new WPI_VictorSPX(INTAKE_MOTOR_ID);
    }

    /**
     * Called periodically when run by the CommandScheduler
     */
    @Override
    public void periodic() {

    }

    public void neutral() {
        state = State.NEUTRAL;
    }

    public void intake() {
        state = State.INTAKING;
    }

    public void eject() {
        state = State.EJECTING;
    }
}
```

We will reference these functions when creating our commands.

Now, we have a variable to represent the current state of the intake, but we aren't actually doing anything with that state. The way we actually use it is through the `periodic()` function that looks at the current `state` and updates all of the actuators accordingly. This function will be automatically run every 20 ms (the same rate as `autonomousPeriodic()`, `teleopPeriodic()`, etc.)

For this subsystem, we want to set the speed of `intakeMotor` depending on the state.

```java
package frc.robot.subsystems;

import static frc.robot.Constants.*;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj2.command.SubsystemBase;
import com.ctre.phoenix.motorcontrol.can.WPI_VictorSPX;

public class Intake extends SubsystemBase {

    private WPI_VictorSPX intakeMotor;

    public enum State {
        NEUTRAL,
        INTAKING,
        EJECTING
    }
    private State state = State.EJECTING;

    public Intake() {
        intakeMotor = new WPI_VictorSPX(INTAKE_MOTOR_ID);
    }

    /**
     * Called periodically when run by the CommandScheduler
     */
    @Override
    public void periodic() {
        switch(state) {
        case NEUTRAL:
            intakeMotor.set(0);
            break;
        case INTAKING:
            intakeMotor.set(-1.0);
            break;
        case EJECTING:
            intakeMotor.set(1.0);
            break;
        }
    }

    public void neutral() {
        state = State.NEUTRAL;
    }

    public void intake() {
        state = State.INTAKING;
    }

    public void eject() {
        state = State.EJECTING;
    }
}
```

## Using RobotContainer.java

Now that we have created the class for our intake in `Intake.java`, it is time to actually add the code for it to `RobotContainer.java`. We first have to create an instance of the `Intake`, and then we must utilize it.

```java
package frc.robot;

import edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.*;

public class RobotContainer {

    private final Intake intake;

    private final XboxController controller;

    /**
     * The container for the robot.  Contains subsystems, OI devices, and commands.
     */
    public RobotContainer() {
        intake = new Intake();

        controller = new XboxController(CONTROLLER_ID);

        configureButtonBindings();
    }

    /**
     * Use this method to define your button -> command mappings.
     */
    private void configureButtonBindings() {

    }
}
```

## Next Steps

Now, the overall structure of our intake is pretty well defined. Next up, we will look at how we actually go about using commands to control it.
