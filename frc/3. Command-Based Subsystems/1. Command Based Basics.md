# Command-Based: A Brief Overview

To organize our robot code, we use what is known as a "command-based" design pattern. Essentially, in this framework, all mechanisms on our robot are grouped into what are known as `subsystems`, and each of these `subsystems` are able to run certain `commands`. In almost all cases, every action our robot can perform will be a `command`.

## Subsystems

All subsystems on a robot are composed of a few things: actuators (motors/pistons) and sensors. However, we won't worry too much about sensors right now.

Each of these subsystems will have a few actions it can do with these actuators. For instance, a drivetrain can be moved with manual driver control. An intake could either take in or eject a game piece. An elevator can use either manual control, or precise control to get to a specific position.

## Commands

Each of those aforementioned actions are a `command`. At any given time, a `subsystem` can have a single `command` running on it. There are many ways to set the current `command` of a subsystem. The most simple way to do so is to define the default `command` of a subsystem, which will run when no other specified action is sent. The next way to set `commands` to a `subsystem` is to schedule a `command` to be sent when a certain button is pressed on a controller.

For instance, a roller intake might be set up such that whenever nothing is being pressed on the controller, its default `command` is to run at a low, constant speed. Then, if the A button is pressed, we could schedule it to run an ejecting command, and when the B button is pressed, we might schedule it so that it runs an intaking command.

## Scheduler

The way WPILib handles all of `command-based` is through something known as the `CommandScheduler`. Its function is right in the name: it executes commands that are called, preventing conflicts between commands (e.g. stopping an elevator from moving up and down simultaneously), and removing completed or interrupted commands. We have to constantly call the `CommandScheduler` to make sure it actually reads our commands and sets the robot into action. Inside our `periodic` functions, or rather in Robot.java's `robotPeriodic()`, we will put the line `CommandScheduler.getInstance().run();`. As a result, the scheduler's `run()` method will be called once every 20 ms. 

## RobotContainer Class

This is an essential class that goes in our project, and, as described by WPILib, is "where the bulk of the robot should be declared. Very little robot logic should actually be handled in the `Robot` class' periodic methods (other than the scheduler calls). Instead, the structure of the robot (including subsystems, commands, and button mappings) should be declared here."

Previously, in the command-based framework, we would define their button bindings in a class known as `OI`, and place subsystem-updating loops into `Robot.java` itself. However, those requirements have been consolidated into one class: `RobotContainer.java`.
