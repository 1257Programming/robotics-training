# TODO Changes for the 2021 Season

Reformat the entire thing to start from command based and talk about basic subsystems. Rationale: it was way too confusing to start with basic motor code and then dive into command based.

Have everything be based off of the template repository so that people can even program and practice on a chromebook.

First people should be introduced to the basic architecture. Then they can be thrown into making an arm -> intake -> drivetrain. Reference to the 2020 Robot a LOT. There should be a further section on shuffleboard, closed loop control, and autonomous control. Autonomous control should deal with putting actions in sequence / in parallel and then go into detail about drivetrain.
