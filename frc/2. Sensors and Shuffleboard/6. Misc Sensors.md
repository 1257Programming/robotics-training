# Misc. Sensors

There are various other sensors that are less commonly used, but you may see sometimes. We will list some here as well as links to where you can find out how to program them. Note that sometimes if you're using sensors made by other companies, you made need to install vendor libraries to handle these.

Many of the more basic types of sensors can be found here: [Sensors](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/sensors/ultrasonics-software.html)

There are some examples such as REV Robotics color sensor (which we have used in the past). The sensor can detect the color of what it looks at and can also serve as a distance sensor.
