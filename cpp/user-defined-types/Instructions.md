# Point Class

1. Create a class called *Point* in a header file (with a header guard)
2. Define attributes for a RECTANGULAR POINT (I'm looking at you Harsh)
3. Create a constructor that defines a new point
4. Create a 'print' function that prints out "Point(<x>, <y>)", where <x> and <y> are the member attributes that you will define
5. Create a 'distanceTo(<another point>)' method that returns a double which is the distance between a given point and the provided point
