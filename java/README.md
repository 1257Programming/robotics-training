# Programming Subteam

## Programming Language

This year, we will be using Java to write our robot code. In the past, we have used C++ but we have made the decision to use Java.

* [Reference TutorialsPoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_datatypes.htm)
* [Reference Princeton](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/)
* [More Advanced Reference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html)
* [Exercises](http://programmingbydoing.com/)
* [Cheatsheet](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/11cheatsheet/)

## IDEs

Java programs are usually written in an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. For robot programming, we'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). However, we cannot install IDEs on Chromebooks, so for now, we will be using an online cloud based IDE called codeanywhere.com.

## [repl.it](https://repl.it/)

Go to repl.it. Type Java in the center box and click "Java". On the left you will see your files, in the center is your code, and on the right is your code output. You can push the "Run" botton at the top to run your code.

If you want, you can create an account. This will allow you to save your projects and share them with other people. I have created a classroom where I will post assignments and exercises you can tackle. Once you create an account, you can DM me on Slack (My username is rchang), or ask me in person to add you to the classroom.

## Why We Use Java

* Many other teams use Java, giving us more reference material
* In general, people have stated that Java is easier to learn

## Curriculum

Don't worry if you have no clue what these things are, we will go over all of them and try our best to teach you them. Anything with a star (*) next to it is essential and you should expect to see frequently in robotics programming. Anything without a star is still good to know, but you will make it by without knowing those.

* Basics (1 day)
  * First Program *
  * Variables *
  * Operators *
  * Comments *
* Control-Flow (1 day)
  * If/Else Statements *
  * Logical Operators *
  * Switch Statements *
  * While Loops
  * For Loops
  * Enums *
* Functions (2 days)
  * Basic Functions *
  * Functions w/ Arguments *
  * Functions w/ Return Types *
  * Overloading
* Objects (2 days)
  * Objects *
  * Classes *
  * Inheritance *
  * Overriding *
  * Polymorphism

Once we finish these topics, we will go onto robotics programming.

## Disclaimer

This course teaches you a lot about making programs in Java, but it does not go fully in depth. One major thing is that we do not teach arrays since they are very rarely used in robotics programming. After build season, we might teach this so that people can learn more about the Java language.

## Help

If you need help, don't feel shy to ask a senior member or the captain about any programming questions. It is difficult to learn programming in under a few months, so don't feel bad about any difficulties you are having. Good luck!

## Typos

If you find any mistakes, tell me or even better, after we learn Git, make an issue and/or pull request on GitHub to notify me of the problem.
