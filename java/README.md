# Programming Subteam

## Programming Language
This year, we will be using Java to write our robot code. In the past, we have used C++ but we have made the decision to use Java.

## Course Structure
The general course structure will be outlined in the "java/2019 Training Curriculum" folder. For each ".md" file, there will be a list of goals, tasks, and reference materials. Additionally, in the "java" folder, there will be a folder with the same name. In there, you will find relevant information and programs. We will typically spent 2-3 days on each topic, with some days of lectures and others of assignments to reinforce information.

## IDEs
Java programs are usually written in an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. For robot programming, we'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). However, we cannot install IDEs on Chromebooks, so for now, we will be using an online programming environment called repl.it.

## repl.it

Go to [repl.it](https://repl.it/). Type Java in the center box and click "Java". On the left you will see your files, in the center is your code, and on the right is your code output. You can push the "Run" botton at the top to run your code. 

If you want, you can create an account. This will allow you to save your projects and share them with other people. I have created a classroom where I will post assignments and exercises you can tackle. Once you create an account, you can DM me on Slack (My username is rchang), or ask me in person to add you to the classroom.

## Why We Use Java

* Many other teams use Java, giving us more reference material
* In general, people have stated that Java is easier to learn

## What We Need for Robot Programming

Don't worry if you have no clue what these things are, we will go over all of them and try our best to teach you them.
* Variables
* Control Statements (If, While, For)
* Object-Oriented Concepts
* User-Defined Types
* Version Control

## What You Should Do

We all go to one of the UCVTS schools, and we have a ton of schoolwork. However, to get good at programming, you will want to spent at least 10 minutes each day familiarizing youself with the language and trying out random things. Just coming to robotics twice a week won't make you a great programmer, but practice will. 

## Help

If you need help, don't feel shy to ask a senior member or the captain about any programming questions. It is difficult to learn programming in under a few months, so don't feel bad about any difficulties you are having. Good luck!

## Typos

If you find any mistakes, tell me or even better, after we learn Git, make an issue and/or pull request on Github to notify me of the problem.
