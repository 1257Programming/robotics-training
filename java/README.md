# Programming Subteam

## Programming Language
This year, we will be using Java to write our robot code. In the past, we have used C++ but we have made the decision to use Java.

## Course Structure
The general course structure will be outlined in the "java/2019 Training Curriculum" folder. For each ".md" file, there will be a list of goals, tasks, and reference materials. Additionally, in the "java" folder, there will be a folder with the same name. In there, you will find relevant information and programs. We will typically spent 2-3 days on each topic, with some days of lectures and others of assignments to reinforce information.

## IDEs
Java programs are usually written in an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment. For robot programming, we'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). However, we cannot install IDEs on Chromebooks, so for now, we will be using an online programming environment called _____.

## Why We Use Java
* Many other teams use Java, giving us more reference material
* In general, people have stated that Java is easier to learn

## What We Need for Robot Programming
Don't worry if you have no clue what these things are, we will go over all of them and try our best to teach you them.
* Variables
* Control Statements (If, While, For)
* Object-Oriented Concepts
* User-Defined Types
* Version Control

## What You Should Do
Obviously, we all go to one of the UCVTS schools, and we have a ton of schoolwork. However, to get good at programming, you will want to spent at least 10 minutes each day familiarizing youself with the language and trying out random things. Just coming to robotics twice a week won't make you a great programmer, but practice will. 

## Help
If you need help, don't feel shy to ask a senior member or the captain about any programming questions. It is difficult to learn programming in under a few months, so don't feel bad about any difficulties you are having. Good luck!
