# Inheritance

Before, we discussed a multitude of different types of objects. For instance, we had books, cars, people, etc. Now what if we had the following objects: Doctor, Worker, Dentist, Librarian, Student, Teacher, etc. What do all of these objects share in common? They're all People with names, ages, abilities (walking, talking). As a result, when we define all of these objects, we have to include all of these. However, this gets tiring quickly. As a result, Java has a feature known as **inheritance**.

## Extends

Here is a basic Person class.

```java
public class Person
{
    String m_name;
    int m_age;

    Person(String name, int age)
    {
        m_name = name;
        m_age = age;
    }

    void walk()
    {
        System.out.println("Person " + name + " is walking.");
    }
}
```

Without inheritance, if we wanted to add a Doctor and a Librarian, we would have to do the following:

```java
public class Doctor
{
    String m_name;
    int m_age;
    String m_field;

    Doctor(String name, int age, String field)
    {
        m_name = name;
        m_age = age;
        m_field = field;
    }

    void walk()
    {
        System.out.println("person " + name + " is walking.");
    }
}
```

```java
public class Librarian
{
    String m_name;
    int m_age;
    String m_libraryName;

    Librarian(String name, int age, String libraryName)
    {
        m_name = name;
        m_age = age;
        m_libraryName = libraryName;
    }

    void walk()
    {
        System.out.println("Person  " + name + " is walking.");
    }
}
```

Notice that we are repeating code. Both `Doctor` and `Librarian` are `People`, and therefore have `m_name` and `m_age`. Imagine if we had 100 different types of people! This would be a lot of repeated code. And what if we had to change `Person` to also include their id? Then we would have to change 100 other files besides `Person.java`. To show this relationship between `Doctor` and `People` (as well as `Librarian` and `People`), we use something called **`inheritance`**.

To represent that Object A **IS** a Object B, we use the Java word **`extends`**.

```java
public class Doctor extends Person
{
    String m_field;

    Doctor(String name, int age, String field)
    {
        super(name, age);
        m_field = field;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Librarian extends Person
{
    String m_libraryName;

    Librarian(String name, int age, String libraryName)
    {
        super(name, age);
        m_libraryName = libraryName;
    }
}
```

Ok, let's break down what just happened. Everything that we had before, that was part of `Person`, we no longer need to include in `Doctor` and `Librarian`. Instead, **`extends`** will take care of it for us and put all of that stuff inside of `Doctor` and `Librarian`. For instance, the following will still work:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    Doctor doctor = new Doctor("Mike", 31, "Computer Science");
    System.out.println(doctor.m_age);
}
```

The `m_age` variable is **`inherited`** from `Person`. The same can be said for functions. With this method, we can make more powerful and flexible program structures.

Next, the thing that is probably unfamiliar is the line `super(name, age)`. What this does is that it calls the parent class' constructor (in this case, it's `Person`'s constructor) with the arguments provided. Essentially, `super()` is just a keyword to call the parent class` version of that method.
