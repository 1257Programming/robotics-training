# Algorithms

## Goals

* Learn basic algorithms
* Develop problem solving and critical thinking abilities

# Algorithms

Note: Try to write functions for all of these that take in an array and either return the output or print the output. 

* Search an array for a specific element
* Find the total sum of the elements in an array
* Find the average of all of the elements in an array
* Find the maximum/minimum value in an array
* Swap two elements in an array (This function will take in 3 parameters, the array, the first index, and the second index)

* More Advanced Algorithms:
    * Find the median of an array
        * Note: There are many valid ways to do this task. Try to think of more than one, and determine which one is the best

    * Given a 3x3 array of chars representing a TicTacToe board, output whether the game is in progress, a win for X, a win for O, or a tie.
        * In this case, ' ' represents empty, 'X' represents X, 'O' represents O
        * For instance: 
            * {{'O', ' ', 'X'},
               {'X', ' ', 'X'},
               {'O', 'O', 'X'}}
               is a win for X
