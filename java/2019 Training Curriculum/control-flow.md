# Conditionals

## Goals

* Learn what the conditional operators are
* Learn what `if`, `else`, and `else if` statements are
* Learn what a `switch` statement is

## Tasks

* Have the user input a number, and then print if the number is even or odd
* Have the user enter their number grade, and then print their letter grade
* Have the user enter a number, and then print out all numbers leading up to that number.
  * For instance, if the user enters "5", print "1 2 3 4 5"
* Calculator: Create a program that will have the user input a number, an operator, another number, and then evaluate the expression and print out an answer. (Optional: print out the whole equation.)
  * For instance, here is the program being run:
    * "Enter the first number: "
      * User Input: "1"
    * "Enter the operation: "
      * User Input: "+"
    * "Enter the second number: "
      * User Input: "4"
    * "1 + 4 = 5"
* Have the user enter a number, and then print out the following pattern:
  * User entered 5
  * Output:
