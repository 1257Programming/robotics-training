## Tasks

* Build a die simulator that outputs the result of rolling a random die
  * Bonus: Output the result of rolling a pair of dice. You can either output the sum or both numbers individually
* Build a grade keeper program that maintains an ArrayList of all of your grades. You can enter commands like "add 84" to add grades to that list, and then output all of your grades, as well as the average. You can also use commands like "remove 2" to remove the second element from the ArrayList.
